The repository contains a MATLAB-MEX interface that allows users to use the Universal Hardware Driver (UHD) C++ library for Software Defined Radio (SDR) in MATLAB. The interface enables MATLAB users to use SDR hardware from Ettus Research (such as USRP devices) to perform radio communication, receive and transmit signals, and perform other tasks in the field of Software Defined Radio.

The repository contains the source code for the MATLAB-MEX interface, as well as examples that demonstrate how to use the interface to connect to an SDR device, receive and transmit signals, and perform other SDR tasks. The goal of the repository is to provide MATLAB users with easy access to the UHD library and enable them to develop and execute SDR applications in MATLAB.

By using the MATLAB-UHD interface, MATLAB users can combine the comprehensive signal processing and analysis functionality of MATLAB with the powerful SDR hardware capabilities of UHD to develop SDR applications quickly and efficiently. Additionally, MATLAB users can view, analyze, and visualize the results of their SDR applications directly in MATLAB, making the development process faster and more effective.
